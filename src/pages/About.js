      <p>I'm a Front-End developer in the UK with a big interest in development be it on the web or in games to ultimately provide a great user experience.</p>
      <p>Eager to learn and a passion for overcoming challenges and problem solving. When I'm not writing code or being creative you'll find me practicing martial arts, adventuring outdoors or sitting peacefully reading a book.</p>
      <p>Always on the lookout for taking my knowledge and skills to the next level, you'll never find me without a drive to learn new skills.</p>
